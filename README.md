# weather-app-withAPI-

The weather app:

 - Takes a city name as required input.
 - Take an optional flag to display the output in Fahrenheit instead of Celsius, if desired.
   - If Fahrenheit is desired, type -i after tying the city before pressing enter.
 - The Weather App calls an online weather API called 'OpenWeather' to fetch the weather data.
 - Display the city name, the current weather conditions, the current temperature and the feels like temperature.
 - Format the output visually using colors, spacing, and emojis.
